# Helmet

Designed to protect the display in the event of a crash. 

## Shroud Split Variant

@banada contributed a split variant for small printers. In this version the two halves can be screwed together with a M4*20 bolt.

## V2.1

* Base: Removed a bit of material to fit the head of the C3 stand's M6 bolt

* No longer blocking `dcamera` periphery
* Extended the frame a few more mm for increased protection

## V1

It's not the best looking, but it's a single piece and offers some protection.
It has been fit-tested and is slightly small, but can still be installed and offers decent protection.
